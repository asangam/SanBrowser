<h4> I Have stopped working in this project and will be implementing the same project using CefSharp which lets us embed Chromium in .NET apps <h4>

Here is the Work in progress for the SanBrowserV1 which uses the cefSharp library(based on chromium project) rather than the typical Internet Explorer controls and UI.
